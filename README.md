# Dotdotdot

## General info
This repository holds my dotfiles. Specifically, zsh, tmux, and emacs.

If you ever want to copy my dotfiles to your own system just run update.sh. This will overwrite your dotfiles, so use it carefully. But, using update.sh would be nice if you're setting up emacs on a new system.

## Notes
My notes on the packages I use can be found in notes.txt
