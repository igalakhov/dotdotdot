* Notes on packages

- Web mode set to work on basically every file related to the web.
- Auto closing, auto quoting, and quto paring is enabled.

- Bound to C-c b but also fires automatically on web file save.
** py-yapf
- Python formatter.
- Works on save.
*** TODO Probably should bind this to work with C-c b.
** nyan-mode
- Nyan mode. Makes a nice thing at the bottom.
** yaml-mode
- Yaml mode for editing yml files.
- Newline and indent works automatically.
** magit
- Magit git interaction library.
- I currently don't use it too often because I don't work with complex git a lot.
** doom-themes
- Nice themes for emacs.
- Not all of them work in terminal emacs.
- I use doom-solarized-dark because it's the same layout as my terminal.
- Comments are also made brighter.

- Amazing mode for javascript.
- Allows for refactoring.
** org
- Org mode!
- TODO sequences are TODO, IN-PROGRESS, WAITING, and DONE
- C-c l, C-c a, C-c c are bound to various parts of org-mode
- Auto indent is on because it looks nicer.
