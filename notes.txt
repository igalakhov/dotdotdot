Notes for emacs:

Currently used packages:
* means the package is not current required/in-use

projectile (project management) (mapped to C-c p)
jedi (python helper)
web-mode (web mode) (works with anything web related)
ace window (easy window switcher) (mapped to M-o)
web-beautify (web formatter)
py-yapf (python formatter)
*sublimity (smooth scroller)
nyan-mode (nyan mode)

Notes:
py-yapf requires yapf to be installed with pip
web-beautify requires js-beautify install with npm
Currently, web-beautify works with C-c b but py-yapf doesn't)
sublimity is a bit buggy, probably will uninstall
Nyan mode doesn't use the image, so it's not annoying
